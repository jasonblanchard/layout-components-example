# layout-components-example
Two ways to handle shared layouts in a React SPA:
- `v1` uses a [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) route hierarchy.
- `v2` extracts the layout into a layout component.

Both are built with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Follow READMEs to get it set up.
